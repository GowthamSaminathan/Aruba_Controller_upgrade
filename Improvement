Pre-Check Baseline
Auto-Validation for Pre-Check & POST-Check.
Standardize Pre-check report.
TFTP reachability to be checked in Pre-Check.
Add the server reachability (AAA, NTP, Airwave).
Include L3-redundance validation in MM, show lc-cluster vlan probe status on MDs as part of Pre & POST check. 

1.	Can you create a questionnaire rather than filling in the file, using the questionnaire you can create the file for upgrade. Question can have the data that you have filled in the file

	a.	How many MM
	b.	How many MD
	c.	MM IP
	d.	MD IP 
	e.	Number of AP
	f.	Upgrade method, FTP or TFTP
	g.	If FTP enter FTP credentials
	h.	TFTP server IP/FTP server IP 
	i.	Upgrade image name

2.	Can we include the logic to break the MM upgrade, for example if I have 2 cluster, can I upgrade only one cluster

3.	Can you capture the below data also as part of the pre-checks
	a.	Show log
	b.	Show run

4.	I hope we can always stop the script as & when required
